# Insurance Cost Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting insurance costs using a variety of machine learning techniques. The dataset includes parameters such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and annual insurance charges. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of regression models including linear and Ridge regression. The goal is to identify the factors that most significantly impact insurance costs and to create predictive models with high accuracy..

## Goals of the Project:

1. Explore a banking dataset with Pandas.
2. Identify correlations.
3. Visualize the dataset.



## Used Libraries:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
